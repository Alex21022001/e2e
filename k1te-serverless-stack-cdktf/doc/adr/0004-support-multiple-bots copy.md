Date: 2023-09-30

## Status

Under consideration

## Context

Telegram bots has certain limitations, like request rate. Sharing one bot for all tenanats will not scale well.

## Facing

We may have (paid) option to configure bot per tenant. We may consider Telegram payment support to pay for dedicated bot.

This also relates to implementation of request throttling for tenants using shared bot instance

## Decision

TBD

## Consequences

TBD
